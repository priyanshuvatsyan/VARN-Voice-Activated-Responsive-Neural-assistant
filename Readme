## ✨ Features

* 🎙️ **Voice Command Input**
  Speak naturally to add tasks, delete tasks, mark them as done, or ask for help.

* 🤖 **Gemini API-Powered AI**
  Understands your natural language and interprets commands intelligently.

* 📥 **Task Management**
  Add, delete, or mark tasks as done using voice. Tasks are stored persistently.

* 🧠 **Selective Memory**
  Assistant remembers only when you say things like “remember this”.

* 🔊 **Speech Output**
  AI replies are spoken back to the user using Text-to-Speech.

* 🌐 **Firebase Backend**
  Secure storage of tasks, memory, and assistant interactions.

## 📦 Tech Stack

| Layer        | Tech                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Frontend     | React, Vite, JavaScript            |
| Voice Input  | Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) |
| Voice Output | SpeechSynthesis API                |
| Backend      | Firebase (Firestore)               |
| AI Engine    | Gemini API (Google AI)             |
| Express      | Api handeling                      |

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User speaks a command.**
2. The system uses the Web Speech API to transcribe voice to text.
3. The transcription is sent to Gemini with a structured prompt.
4. Gemini returns an action: create / delete / mark\_done / remember / respond.
5. The frontend parses the action and updates Firebase or replies back.
6. AI response is spoken aloud using the Web Speech API (Text-to-Speech).

## 📋 Example Commands

| Say This                                | What Happens               |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| "Add a task to buy milk tomorrow"       | Adds task to Firebase      |
| "Mark the milk task as done"            | Marks task as completed    |
| "Delete the task about groceries"       | Deletes task from Firebase |
| "Remember that I have a meeting at 4PM" | Saves memory               |
